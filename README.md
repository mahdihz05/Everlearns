## Why EverLearns?

Traditional educational platforms for Persian speakers often lack reliable support for professional English courses, leaving learners with poor subtitles or none at all. **EverLearns** bridges this gap with two core innovations:

1. **AI-Generated Subtitles & Translations**:
   - Automatic generation of **English subtitles**.
   - High-quality **Persian translations**, far superior to basic Google Translate results.

2. **AI-Powered Virtual Tutor**:
   - Each course comes with a **custom AI chatbot** trained specifically for the course content.
   - The chatbot can:
     - Answer questions like an expert instructor.
     - Summarize lessons.
     - Generate practice questions.
     - Engage in discussions to clarify concepts.
